3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Ring Buffer): I had a supplemental instructor guide me on how
   to start the create function. Aside from the rb array with the four diff-
   erent element, I realized I needed to create another array called buffer,
   which would be inside the rb array. After that, I did the capacity and size
   functions by returning what the instructions said (I also learned that the
   two were different in that capacity consists of all of the elements in the
   array, whereas size is the number of actual values/items). For the is_empty
   and is_full functions, I utilized if-else statements to compare the values
   and returned a boolean. For enqueue, I assigned buff[last] to x, and added
   it to the end of rb. For dequeue, I assigned v to buff[first] and delete
   and return item from the front of the buffer rb. For the peek function, I
   returned the item from the front of the buffer rb.

   Problem 2 (Guitar String): For the create function, I created a variable N
   of with constant SPS divided by frequency, rounded up to the nearest int.
   I made a ring buffer rb with N elements, and enqueued them with values 0.0,
   and returned rb. The next function create_from_samples was straightforward -
   I created a ring buffer with the length of init elements, and returned rb.
   For the pluck function, I used the enqueue and dequeue functions. For the
   tic function I set 'a' as the enqueue function and 'b' as as the peek
   function. I used the enqueue function and implemented the expression given
   in the question. In the sample function, I peeked and returned the string.

4. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Laura Chamberlain SI Helped me understand the concept of a ring buffer in
                        Problem 1 and how to set up the array.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

    This was a challenging yet enjoyable assignment to do because this was
    the first time a visual client and it was pretty cool to play around
    with. I am eager and excited to see what other projects we will be
    working on in the future.
